It's week 4, and we're learning about 3D printing! Given my goal to make it possible for me and Yanni and to hold hands from across the country, I would like to scan my hand and 3D print a mini version of it! :) Before I do that, I will work in a team to test the design rules for the 3D printer(s) I have access to. This will help when I'm trying to print my own parts.

individual assignment:
  - design and 3D print an object (small, few cm)
     that could not be made subtractively
  - 3D scan an object (and optionally print it)
